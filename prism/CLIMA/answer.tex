\maketitle

\noindent Dear Reviewers, \\

\noindent First of all, the authors would like to thank you for the very useful comments regarding our paper.
To address your comments and changes suggested we have made the following revisions to the submitted manuscript:

\noindent Reviewer 1:
\begin{itemize}

\item We have changed the manuscript title to "`Verifying Team Formation Protocols with Probabilitistic Model Checking"' to reflect that the paper introduces a novel way (and implementation) to analyse algorithm's competitive setting using stochastic two-player games in addition to performing algorithms analysis using well-established techniques. We have also rewritten the contributions list (paragraph 8) to reflect this.

\item We added a paragraph to the introduction (paragraph 3) explaining why \emph{probabilistic} model checking is needed to analyse this algorithm, highlighting all areas where probabilities occur. This includes the case of \textsc{Online} algorithm where agents have to form optimal teams for the probabilistic \emph{distribution} of tasks (in this paper we used uniform, but any other distribution could be considered with only minor changes in the model description).

\item Throughout the paper we clarified the use of synthesis of optimal strategies for agents, in particular paragraphs 1 and 5 of section 4 and paragraph 1 of section 5.

\item The meaning of ``hostile'' has been clasified throughout the paper by mnaking comparison with two player zero-sum game (e.g. paragraph 5 in section 1, paragraph 1 in section 5). Cooperative agents try to maximise the given reward whereas hostile try to maximise the inverse if it. The solution of STPG provides the ``optimal'' strategy for hostile agents which minimises the expectation of reward. This can be interpreted as ``programming'' of hostile agents.

\item To comment on why this problem not a straighforward task allocation problem with multiple \emph{processes} we would like to draw reviewers attention the analysis of the competitive stochastic game setting where \emph{processes} become \emph{players} having opposite goals and not yet having any pre-programmed execution strategies.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Reviewers 2 and 3:
\begin{itemize}

\item The typesetting has been revised.
\item Note has been added to line 9 in Algorithms 1 and 2 to reflect the condition in the \textsc{Online} version of the algorithm.
\item More focus has been given to the analysis using Bar charts rather than table in the DTMC and MDP analysis sections.


\end{itemize}

\noindent Yours faithfully,\\
