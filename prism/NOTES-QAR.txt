minor stuff:
- remove comments from 
   src/simulator/TransitionList.java
   public int getTotalIndexOfTransition(int i, int offset)
- add christian copyright

-explicit switch

- need to fix deadlock handling
- need to disable more stuff that is currently n/a

actions in MDPSparse
- not complete, doesn't do non-storage (null) by default?

stack:

- can we speed up stpg val iter with gs?
  implemented seems to work, need to look up
  need to clarify prob 1 self-loop issues (easy-ish i think; mdps too)
  (not policy iter though i guess?)

bugs:

- can have dupe initial states - oops

notes:

- implemented policy iteration
- still a few todos
- also is "implicit" method really best for dtmc from mdp+adv?

thoughts:

- need basic access to models: getProb(i, k, j) etc.
- (and tidy up other stats e.g. numTransitions in MDP.java, maxNumDistrs() etc.)
- then shouldn't need to re-implement non-fast methods (e.g. exportToDot)
- but where to put them? superclass? MDPExplicit? shared between e.g. simple/sparse
- also push e.g. initial state stuff into ModelExplicit?
